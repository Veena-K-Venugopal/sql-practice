üìù Problem Description:
Find the average time each machine takes to complete a process rounded off to 3 decimal places
Return the resulting table in any order.
(We are using pivoting pattern here)

üßæ Table Schema:
Table: Activity
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+

----------------------------------------
üí° Thought Process:
- Combine start and end timestamped rows into columns
- Use conditional aggregation to get one row per machine_id + process_id, and pull values into separate columns based on condition
- That is, if the row is a start, give the timestamp in the start_time column and if it is end, give the timestamp in the end_time column
- If a CASE statement doesn't have an ELSE, SQL defaults it to NULL
- Use MAX() to collapse multiple rows into one, extracting the value
- Use GROUP BY machine_id, process_id to ensure one row per process
- After pivoting calculate duration and average by each machine
- Use ROUND() to get the decimal places correct
